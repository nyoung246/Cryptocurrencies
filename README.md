# Cryptocurrencies

## Analysis

This analysis is to assist Martha in preparing the clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. We were to generate a report of what cryptocurrencies are traded in the market and how they are grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. Martha has decided to use unsupervised learning as there is no known output. And a clustering algorithm was used to group the cryptocurrencies. And data visualization was used to share the findings.
